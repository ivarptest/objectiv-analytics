**Objectiv** enables you to collect model-ready data and run your entire product analytics workflow straight from your notebook. It's designed to skip the typical grunt work: no tracking plans, data cleaning and transformations are required. Just open your notebook and start modeling right away with pandas-like operations that run on the full SQL dataset.

![Objectiv Stack](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/img/objectiv-stack.svg "Objectiv Stack")

It includes what you need to answer common product analytics questions with speed and precision, while
providing a solid foundation for advanced modeling. You can output models to SQL queries with a single
command, and Pandas compatability means you can tap into its rich machine learning ecosystem.
